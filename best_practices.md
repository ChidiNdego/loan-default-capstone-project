Here are suggested tips and best practices for this project.


*   Azure has provided as a good pool of options for creating data pipelines. You can explore that as well https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines

*   Good Reference on architecture diagram - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/

*   A good consolidated page from Azure on HyperDrive Experiments - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters

*   The link has good curation of publicly available data set , which you can explore for more experiments https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

*   For Checking Open Datasets in Azure you can check this link https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/open-datasets/catalog/

*   Good Reference on various ML packages that you can incorporate in Azure https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-tools-data-science
